# Teach Your Parents Smartphone üì±

A simple application with step-by-step tutorials to help parents learn essential mobile apps.

## Why I Created This

When PhonePe changed their UI, my parents panicked and blamed me for "breaking" their phone. I sat with them and spent 2 hours teaching them the new interface step-by-step.

I've seen my friends face the same problem with their parents too. We all spend valuable time teaching them, but they often forget without practice.

That's why I built this tool - I still spend some time teaching them personally for that connection, but now they can practice on their own whenever they want. No more repeated explanations every time an app updates!

It's also perfect for teaching them existing features they don't know about. Whenever I want to show them a new feature, I can add a simple tutorial here for them to practice with.
