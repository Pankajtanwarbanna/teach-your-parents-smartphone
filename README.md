# Teach Your Parents Smartphone üì±

A simple application with step-by-step tutorials to help parents learn essential mobile apps.

## Why I Created This

When [PhonePe](https://www.phonepe.com/) updated their design, I noticed how challenging it was for my parents to adapt. They actually thought I had broken their phone! I spent two hours patiently teaching them the new interface step by step.

I've seen my friends face the same problem with their parents too. We all spend time teaching them, but they often forget without practice.

That's why I built this tool - so parents can practice on their own after I teach them personally. The tutorials can be watched as many times as needed, without anyone rushing or judging them. It's also helpful for learning existing features they don't know about. I created this because I want to help my parents feel more confident using their phones while saving everyone time. Simple practice makes learning new technology much easier.
