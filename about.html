            <h2>Why I Built This</h2>
            <p>When PhonePe updated their design, I noticed how challenging it was for my parents to adapt. They actually thought I had broken their phone! I spent two hours patiently teaching them the new interface step by step.</p>
            
            <p>My friends told me they face the same problem with their parents too. We all spend time teaching them, but they often forget without practice.</p>
            
            <p>That's why I built this tool - so parents can practice on their own after I teach them personally. The tutorials can be watched as many times as needed, without anyone rushing or judging them. It's also helpful for learning existing features they don't know about. I created this because I want to help my parents feel more confident using their phones while saving everyone time. Simple practice makes learning new technology much easier.</p>
            
            <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
